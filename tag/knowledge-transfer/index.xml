      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, we address the problem of re-training a deep neural network for a new class with limited training data (n to n+1 class learning) using a novel concept of Deep part embeddings (DPEs). DPEs are sub-networks of neuron activation extracted from a trained network identifying a visual and distinguishable element of a class. We identify visual elements that intuitively constitute a new class and extract the corresponding DPEs from the network pre-trained for the class sharing the identified visual element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we assemble them into a new network and re-train the model on limited samples of the new class and a subset of data from `n&amp;rsquo; classes to achieve high accuracy on the new class without significantly affecting the accuracy of n classes. We studied and generated results for DPE integration under two configurations- (i) sequential, when DPEs are sourced from different CNN architectures and (ii) shared; when DPEs are sourced from the same CNN architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
